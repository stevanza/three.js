 a browser-based 3D project that uses Three.js to render interactive 3D characters and simple game scenes. The project features a collection of animal models and a basic game interface, showcasing animation, loading, and display capabilities in a web environment.

🧩 Features
🐔 3D Character Display: View and interact with various 3D animal models (chicken, cow, lion, pig, rabbit)

🕹️ Mini Game Environment: Includes a simple game with basic display mechanics

🌐 HTML/CSS/JavaScript Based: Lightweight, no external frameworks

🔄 Modular Structure: Organized into clear folders for characters, game logic, and assets

🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
   
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/stevanza-three.js.gitcd stevanza-three.js`

2. Open any .html file in a browser

- load.html – Loads or routes to other scenes

- characters/index.html – Displays animal models

- game/index.html – Starts the game interface

⚠️ This project works best when served via a local web server (due to GLB model loading). You can use a simple server like:

`# Using Python (for example) python -m http.server`

Then go to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
